                                working in technology is as much about learning as it is about performing. He was able to 
                                quickly able to pick up new technology and run with it. Bill excels at understanding and 
                                writing complex .NET web sites using Ektron CMS400.NET and he is capable of intermingling 
                                that technology with web designs and strategies using XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery). 
                                It was my pleasure to work with and get to know Bill and I would welcome the opportunity to do so again.
