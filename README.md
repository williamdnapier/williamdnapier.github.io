## About this site
This website is my personal portfolio site which shows some of the applications I've built using ASP.NET, JavaScript and CSS. Most of the sites shown as part of this portfolio are older and do not rely on newer technologies I've started using over the past few years. Recently, I've been building solutions using .NET Core and the newer JavaScript SPA-style frameworks/libraries including React, Angular and Vue.
