## About this site
This website is my personal portfolio site which shows some of the applications I've built using ASP.NET, JavaScript and CSS. Most of the sites shown as part of this portfolio are older and do not rely on newer technologies I've started using over the past few years. Recently, I've been building solutions using .NET Core and the newer JavaScript SPA-style frameworks/libraries including React, Angular and Vue.

## More to come?
Perhaps. Over the past 4 years I've been working on more internal-facing applications and solutions. So, I've been working on some demo apps which I'm adding as Github repos to demonstrate fundamental concepts -- specifically in regards to Angular, React and Vue.

## Whats next?
I intend to build (3) versions of the same app (if possible) using 1) Angular 2) React and finally 3) Vue. This should serve to show both current and future employers and recruiters I have the skills necessary to develop and deploy code using those frameworks and libraries.
